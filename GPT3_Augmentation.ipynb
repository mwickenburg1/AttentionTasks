        "So speaking for me, uh, something that is. Accessible easy for our team members to use. Mm-hmm <affirmative> requires limited. You know, let's limited burden administrative burden on us. And something that, um, That provides notification to relevant parties that somebody is on leave or is, you know, applying for relief. Um, so again, just to reduce that administrative burden on our part, I'd say ditto. Um, Make it easier, especially, uh, uh, Digital, some of them are not as digital friendly. \n",
        "\n",
        "Okay. Got it. Well, uh, I think, you know, with, with that, I think both of you will be pleasantly surprised at what Sparrow has to offer here. So Sparrow was built to help employers like yourselves care for their employees during major life events. So each employee leave can truly be as stress free as possible. Uh, we are the first true end to end leave management solution to effortlessly care for your people. Finding and keeping people has really become harder than ever, uh, medical, dental, vision, 401k. Those were the primary benefits employees asked about over time. Those benefits became patted with benefits like FSAs, HSA, short and long-term disability. But now all of the, those are much more like table stakes. They're all still very important, but some. Are along the way, the conversation amongst employees shifted and even prior to the pandemic, people, leaders started to realize how they cared for their employees would become more important. They started to see employees actually voice what's meaningful to the them and to their loved ones. From home equity work, life balance. What they heard and saw was a range of what people started to share. That was actually on their mind. \n",
        "\n",
        "I'm curious in this word cluster, what's standing out to either of you. \n",
        "\n",
        "Values is something we definitely, um, we definitely strive on, uh, work by balances also, uh, a good one work from home. Um, that's been a huge, obviously I think most companies these days and lot, so. Yeah, morale. I always, we're always trying to do what's best for the employee and what's gonna make it the easiest for the employee. \n",
        "\n",
        "Love it. Are you hearing any of these other. From from your peers or your colleagues. \n",
        "\n",
        "The corporate social sensibility is something that we, we, we are a big emphasis on, it's not something that our specific team does, but we have a team at snap that's relatively new that, um, their entire, I mean, their titles are really corporate social responsibility specialists, so that's their entire role. So that's another big, big one. \n",
        "\n",
        "Amazing. Well, uh, you know, the pandemic magnified, what was most important to employees? \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, I'm gonna call it flexibility here. And when there was MIS misalignment employees started to resign and tens of millions have resigned over the last, you know, eight, 10 months caring companies that put people first emerged and provided a new class of benefits that here at Sparrow were calling internally. Employee care management. Companies emerge to address employee leave management, fertility benefits, mental wellness, behavioral health, D E and I, and family care. Um, at snapper, you offering any of these today. I was so. See your therapy, mental, uh, mental wellness is, is something for sure. Behavior health. Yeah. I mean, most of those things we offer to a certain extent, fertility, um, not something we've we dove into too much yet though. \n",
        "\n",
        "Got it. Well, a handful of these, uh, are spar customers as well that you you'll see when we get to the, the logo slide. Um, have either of you heard of hashtag show us your leave. I not. So it was started by the skim originally and, and hashtag show us your leave started really becoming a trending topic on social media. And I would courage, you know, either of you to whatever social media outlet use type in hashtag show us your leave. Um, employers were actually getting called out for more transparency, um, while carry companies were using it as a. Differentiator to help them attract and retain talent. So a little bit about Sparrow. Um, we have been in business since 2018. We do have a world class end user net promoter score of 76 and a 99% customer retention rate. We manage all types of leave in the us and Canada while saving 20 plus hours and up to $30,000 in average savings per leave. And here are some of our happy customers at Sparrow from Latice rippling lemonade, human interest, head space, the Los Angeles Clippers and the San Francisco giants. \n",
        "\n",
        "Nice, but let me. Call out web flow. Uh, they're an amazing story. A really high growth tech company that's scaling rapidly. That values the employee experience. We managed over 40 leaves saved them nearly a thousand HR hours and have received a net promoter score of 89 from their employees that went out. And this leads me to. Your current leave of absence process. Um, I'd love to know what it looks like today. If an employee raises their hand and says they need to go out on leave. \n",
        "\n",
        "So currently we use, uh, our, our HRS ADP. And so we use their lead management solution. And so typically involves us referring them to a website or to make a phone call to ADP, um, that, um, They need, um, they send it back to EP and then, uh, it, you know, typically makes the decision based upon that documentation and just notifies us. It works. Okay. Um, it's not, it's not great just because in general, ADP is not great, but the biggest reason we're searching is cause we're actually leaving the ADP on January one. So, um, with that, we're moving to Workday. So we, we, we need to find. \n",
        "\n",
        "Got it. Okay. Are you moving to Workday for HRS and payroll? Offer any sort of private short term disability today? \n",
        "\n",
        "Uh, yes, we have an employee, employer, employer for visibility at, for great. \n",
        "\n",
        "Any specific carrier you, um, Workday guardian through Lincoln right now. \n",
        "\n",
        "Oh, Lincoln. Changing that over to Unum, um, genuine as well, part as part of the Workday change. <affirmative> a lot of changes coming January one. \n",
        "\n",
        "Oh yeah. I, I imagine your employees are gonna be quite happy to be off of ADP and onto Workday. A lot of them, I think we're gonna have those always just, uh, you know, against, in try to change. And so, yeah, there's always, I think, yeah. Purple. And, um, if an employee goes out on leaves today, like let's use a non birthing caregiver for an example, is that employee eligible to have their salary topped up to a hundred percent. If they happen to be out on leave in a state that offers wage replacement like California, Washington, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts. If it's, I'll obviously if they offer something through the state, right? \n",
        "\n",
        "So, you know, their state, you know, California or state specific disability that they can apply for, um, Uh, you typically don't get too involved in that we, for, for parental leave, we do offer four weeks of paid leave, uh, for people that have been with us for at least a year. Okay. But that the outside of that there is, yeah, everything else is just short term disability or, you know, they can use. You know, approved, pay time off if they wanna cover bar of absence. \n",
        "\n",
        "OK. Got it. And. If you could name or pinpoint your top three or four major pain points with your current leave of Robinsons process today, what would those be? \n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah. Um, So I think that, uh, anytime, I mean, unfortunately, and this is not meant to be disparaging, but anything that I've involves ADP is typically a challenge, um, in our experience. <affirmative> so one perfect example is all of a sudden there's been these, um, forms that we've needed to sign. We've never had to sign them at all in the history of being with ADP for the past, you know, five years, but all of a sudden there's these forms that we have to sign for leave of absences. Uh, we being HR. Um, but of course we can never get ahold of the. <affirmative> so we call ADP, they tell us they're moved and they're talking about, but they're telling our employees that we have these forms that need to be signed. So that's just one of the many things that has been a, a pain point. Um, Say that, um, while, you know, it's all through ADP, there's no actual, um, there's, there's no integration with short term disability with, um, ADP as an H R I S. Right. So if somebody goes out on leave, ADP handles the leap force, but we still have to be manually inactivate the person in, in. P we have to, they have to, you know, they have to call Lincoln to apply for the disrupt disability. So it's a very linter process that involves several different things. Um, rather than being kinda one cohesive solution. \n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah. Um, I mean, can't the, uh, the forms they have to print out and fill out and then scan back in. It can't be a picture. Um, Like that. Love it. Um, So lack of integration sounds like. Communication amongst all parties involved and, you know, printing and scanning sounds like an extremely manual process. \n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah. And how many leaves are you experiencing in a calendar year, in any particular type of leave more than others? \n",
        "\n",
        "Would say probably our, between a hundred and hundred 50 leads per year. Um, They're pretty spread out. I mean, we have quite a few, you know, intermittent FMLAs. Um, and then of course, you know, the parental pizza is probably the next biggest thing. Well here at Sparrow, we manage thousands of weaves at any given time. Uh, we have seen a ton of unique people situations, and here are some examples we've encountered that employees and employers like yourselves are dealing with the unfortunate situation of a late stage miscarriage. \n",
        "\n",
        "Is the, that a medical lead or is it a bereavement leave? If it is. Easement leave. Is the employee eligible for anything more than the three to five days? \n",
        "\n",
        "Your leave policy currently states. A non birthing caregiver with an on an intermittent leave that suddenly needs to take a medical leave. Substance abuse that requires you as an employer to get updates from the employees, family member. Filed forms causing delays in payments for the employee. And we updates to employers from the state and disability insurance carriers. \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, and then managing leaves that started one state and ended another. Experienced any of these complex leave situations? \n",
        "\n",
        "None that I can think of, of the top of my head. I mean, we're, we're usually pretty, just. Yeah, I can't really think of anything that we've had too many issues with. I mean, I guess we did have a challenge with a California non birthing caregiver a few months ago. Um, and really was just that the challenge was confusion between, you know, the state provided disability that they can, that they can file out for or. You know, income, continuation, wherever you wanna call it. And our four weeks of paid leave that we offer, um, It really was just confusion. Um, California is one of only half all states that offer that kinda of kinda benefit. \n",
        "\n",
        "So. Have a good question, Justin, how did you manage that? \n",
        "\n",
        "Because. The non burden caregivers eligible for eight weeks of PFL bonding time in the state of California with a max benefit amount of 1540 a week. If they made more than 134,000 last year. \n",

        "Did you have your employee take that eight weeks of, you know, the max benefit amount, and then you allow them to do the additional four weeks of 100% salary continuation based off of your leave policy, or did you. Use that four weeks to supplement the income over the total of the eight. \n",
        "\n",
        "So really keeping them probably roughly 80% of their salary for the entire entirety. So we used the four weeks at a hundred percent and then they applied for the eight weeks of, of, uh, bonding. \n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah. Yeah. Got it. So we got 12 weeks, but. Them were at, you know, 60 to 70% of their salary. Correct. \n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah. So let's take a look at how Sparrow addresses these situations. We have a dedicated team of subject matter experts employed by Sparrow located in an all time zones across the us. Uh, there's no outsourcing or call centers here at Sparrow. You'll have a dedicated leave specialist. That'll walk you and your employees through the entire leave process and dedicated leave. Specialist has a team behind them ranging from. Onboarding payroll and compliance experts. We've also heard our dedicated leave specialists referred to as leave doulas. It's spar does have the depth and experience to cover all the complexity that is growing with leaves. Um, for example, California has 16 state specific leave laws. New York has 11 New Jersey and Washington each have 10, just to name a few and Colorado and Oregon will be going live with paid leave from the first time as of Jan, January 1st, 2023. With Sparrow know that your organization is gonna be covered in all 50 states plus Canada for all types of leave, including ADA. The only leaves we're not managing today at Sparrow are workers' comp leads. Josh. I saw you and meet there for a second. Any questions? Comments? \n",
        "\n",
        "No good. What's your current us. And if you happen to have Canadian employees, Canadian headcount, Uh, current us for about 700, uh, yeah. One, um, but that that'll be expanding, um, by the end of the year to probably five. Okay. Any of these Canadian employees located in Quebec? \n",
        "\n",
        "I don't think so. No. \n",
        "\n",
        "Okay. Uh, just asking, because today that's the only province in Canada. We're not managing leaves. Uh, the language barrier was more challenging than we had originally anticipated when we rolled out in Canada. Um, the plan is to be managing Canadian leaves, Quebec, um, as of January one, From a technology perspective, HR platforms have evolved over the years, uh, from performance management applicant tracking to learning platforms. And now finally leave management. Sparrow is a true combination of service and software. And I'd say that's what makes us extremely unique in this leap of absence space. Um, the attention to detail, service and knowledge only a human being can provide. With automation that technology can enable. Hear a few screenshots of our easy to use software that provides administrators, such as yourselves with a dashboard to see all of your leave data in a single location. You'll notice the linear line to the right of each employee. That's your employee's leave timelines. So as an administrator, right, when you log in at first glance, you can see exactly where each employee is at throughout their leave. If you click on an employee's name, it's going to take you to that. Employee's leave of absence eligibility file. And within this employee's eligibility file will live the employee's personalized payroll plan. Well as any and all required leave of absence, documentation, whether that be specific to your organization, Sparrow, federal, state, or local governments. Here's a screenshot of the personalized payroll plan that both administrators and employees have access to. We do find there's a lot less confusion and a lot less questions when admins and employees are looking at the exact same figures. You can see the breakdown of where the wage replacement is coming from. And in this specific example, this employee's gonna be receiving income from four different sources throughout their leave. Here at Sparrow do pride ourselves on a 99% payroll accuracy. Um, the way, the way we're able to verify the 99%. Barrow actually files all of the associated state. And in your case, Lincoln paperwork on behalf of your employees going out on leave. Um, so we actually received the notice of computation of the benefit amount. So we can cross reference that our estimates are accurate. What's really nice though, about these personalized payroll plans with Sparrow is we're actually able to help the HR team and the payroll team and the employee figure out exactly what the benefit amount is gonna be. Answer believe and trying to do these calculations internally can be challenging to say the least, because a lot of states. A fit amount. Won't be based off your employee's current salary, but it's gonna be based off that employee's highest paid quarter in the last 18 months. Pure fast growing company. There's a percentage of the headcount that hasn't been with the organization for 18 months. If you're California employer, you can't legally ask an employee what they were paid previously. So if you're trying to do this calculation internally and the employee hasn't been with snap for 18 months, you're basically guessing what the benefit amounts gonna be using half a, the available data. Because Sparrow's a third party. We're able to ask you what the employees currently being paid today and whether or not they've been with your organization for 18 months. And if you indicate to us, they haven't, our software's smart enough to know it needs to ask the employee directly what they were paid previously. At that point in time, our software has all of the inputs necessary to do essentially the exact same calculation that the states do. In advance of your employee going out on leave. So we're able to get HR team, the payroll team and the employee, an extremely accurate estimate of what the state benefit amount is gonna be well in advance of the employee going out on leave or before Sparrow ever filing anything for this employee. \n",
        "\n",
        "Any questions on these personalized payroll plans? \n",
        "\n",
        "So let's take you through how technology people and their expertise, uh, delivers an amazing leave experience. There are four key phases which are policy review, pre leave during leave and return to work. Policy review and recommendations comes loaded with a variety of key deliverables. Um, we start the process off by reviewing your organization's leave policy and providing your team with suggestions. Internally here we are looking at leave policies all day long. We're also embedded on all 150, 50 different HR teams across the country. And. I've noticed almost every single leave policy does have about five or 10 things that are a little broken. I think the primary cause of this is the fact that the leave policies are written by lawyers. So they are legally correct, but lawyers don't necessarily know all of the people op situations that could come up. Right. Pretty common example we see is when leave policies today are still using language like maternity and paternity leave, you could easily end up in a situ. Were two women who have a child together end up with twice as much leave as two men who have a child together. And obviously nowadays, no one intends for that sort of blatant discrimination to happen. It's just the lawyers weren't thinking about this people OB situation when they wrote their leave policy or the company has scaled so quickly that they just haven't had time to go back and review the policy that was, you know, designed and built for a hundred percent company and not they're thought thousand. Here at Sparrow, we can ensure that your leave policies are gonna be robust, inclusive, and prepared to scale with your organization. And along the lines of scaling, we also provide benchmarking data. And the goal behind this benchmarking data is to really help our customers understand. Organizations their specific size are doing and offering. So first and foremost, they can be confident that their leave policy is gonna be competitive and help them recruit and retain experience talent. But what's great about the benchmarking data with Sparrow is we aggregate data on best practices around all areas of the leave policy. So not just the medical leaves and the parental leaves, we are gonna include the leaves that people think of much less frequently, like bereavement leave and transitional leave. We've seen a lot of the, these over the, the last 24 months where a leave started off as a. Are taking leave possibly due to COVID. And unfortunately, a percentage of those leaves did transition into bereavement leaves. Either of, you know, when the last time your leave policy was reviewed or benchmarked. Last year. So in the prelease phase, um, all you need to do is, uh, people ops team is introduce the employee to Sparrow and we take it from there. Um, the experience for the employee is a 10 minute web form in their Sparrow dashboard, where they're verifying a lot of demographic for information that we're pulling the file feed with your HR I system. So, first name, last name. The residential address, the current salary and their start date with your organization. Then they have a 15 minute intake phone call with their dedicated leave specialist, where we walk that employee through exactly what's available to them in terms of eligible job protection and wage replacement, federal state, local, and your specific company policy. Then that employee goes out on, even everything else is being managed on the backend by Sparrow. Also on this intake call, we wanna make sure we're understanding the goals for your employees leave. And everyone does have a different goal. Some employees wanna return to work as soon as possible. If we're using an example of, let's say, uh, a parental leave, maybe this person had been trying to have a child for a few years, and now that child's finally arrived, they prefer to spend a little more time with this child. Even if it means some of the time ends up being unpaid. Is the information that we gather from the intake call to develop a personalized leave plan for the individual. We take the dates from that to create those personalized payroll plans for your organization. Thank you. And then during the leave, your dedicated leave specialist is going to proactively reach out to your employee to check in and see how they're doing. Um, if we're gonna use an example of a birthing caregiver, Dedicated leave specialist is gonna reach out to this employee around the time the child's expected to arrive first and foremost, they wanna make sure everything went smoothly with the delivery. And then we'll complete some basic post delivery paperwork with the new parent, the name of the child, the date they were born will collect the proof of her relationship form at this point in time and submit that to the state and. The carrier on behalf of your employee will also remind that employee that they do only have 30 days to add that child as a dependent to their insurance as a qualifying life event. And then a successful return to work is what this experience is really all about. Will help your team through the final stages that include any payroll, reconciliations to communication with your employee. Your employee happens to file for an extension it's approved. You're dedicated leave specialist is gonna reach out to all of the stakeholders, involved HR business partner, their manager, make them aware that there's a new return to work date for this individual. We also wanna share best practices guide with managers around welcoming the employee back into the office from leave. Simple tips and tricks. You know, if they are returning to a physical office, make sure they have a desk waiting for them when they return, make sure you're introducing them to any new colleagues that may have joined when they were out on leave. And most importantly, in that first week, make sure you're scheduling a one-on-one to, to discuss what the 30, 69 train transition back into the workforce plan looks like for this individual. \n",
        "\n",
        "So, what does this mean for you?\n",
        "\n",
        "Through our tailored white glove leave management experience, Sparrow has transformed the leave ma leave management to attract and retain talent, mitigate federal state, and local compliance, increase your operational efficiencies to maximize employee productivity. And most importantly, here save you and your employees time. And. By containing your costs. And here are some quotes from existing happy customers at Sparrow. So I'd be curious. It to either of you throughout this presentation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Very comprehensive, but you think it, it definitely takes most four boxes. Which has got, we're looking for, for full service, right? \n",
        "\n",
        "A team doesn't have a bandwidth to manage this on our own. So that's all purpose of getting a, getting a vendor. \n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah, pay calculating is awesome. \n",
        "\n",
        "Awesome feature. Yeah. I'd say if you're really sorry about that, Justin, go ahead. I ask question. So I take it that you. Integration capabilities with Workday. So we integrate with all HR systems today via file feed. And the purpose of the integration is to really streamline the leave initiation process. If an employee's going out on leave today without Sparrow. They usually having to put their first name and last name, social security number, a residential address on like six or seven different forms. With Sparrow. We want to pull all of that data that's living within inside of your HR system, the demographic data, and have them verify it. Um, then they sign what we call the designation of authority here at Sparrow, giving their dedicated leave specialists, the authority to submit all of that state and insurance paperwork on behalf of the employee. Also to streamline the process. What a lot of our customers will do from an HR perspective is they'll add their dedicated leave specialist here at Sparrow as an authorized contact on their private short term disability account. So if your carrier sends some sort of notice to your employee, while they're out on the you're employee, won't need to go through the painful process of calling the carrier and sitting on hold. They also won't need to send that notice to your team where you'll have to call the carrier and figure out what the notice means. Instead, they'll just send it to their dedicated leave specialist and a leave specialist can reach out to your carrier directly. For the payroll aspect, we don't integrate with payroll solutions today. What we do is during the implementation process. That you bring someone from your payroll team on, ask them to export a CSV file in the exact format. They'll need it returned to them in and each pay period. Mode a custom payroll report in that exact format outlining to your payroll team, which employees are on leave and how much they need to supplement that employee's income for that particular pay period. \n",
        "\n",
        "I'd be curious about, uh, what other leave of absence options came up when you Google searched and of those, you know, which ones are you gonna be evaluating throughout this process? \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, I, I think that the others are, are really just clear. I mean, we, we considered, and so Lincoln provides a league absence solution. So we're, we're looking at, at, you know, that to see what, um, what they can offer since we already have a relationship with, um, And, um, and then also looking at, at <inaudible> because it's likely that we'll change actually to. There, um, Ability service. So we we're looking at that as well. And then of course, um, somebody, a bigger player said, um, Got it. The last one makes sense. Um, Know, based off of our, our quick conversation here, it sounds like, you know, you care about your employees and the experience that they have when they go out and leave. Um, Imagine the, uh, carrier solutions are gonna be a lot like what your experiencing today with ADP, um, insurance companies are graded insurance. They're not great at customer service. So the employee experience really, really isn't a top priority for them as organization. Um, their N score state states it and a whole right. Most of insurance companies are living in the like negative 10 to. Of 30 NPS score. Um, there's a reason that Sparrow has an NPS score of 76. \n",
        "\n",
        "No, uh, a very good point, right? It's that? It's sure. Companies trying to add additional things to their portfolios, but are, are they good at it? Is the question. So yeah. You know, it's definitely something that we're considering. Sure. Yeah. It's funny. We've actually seen an uptick of the insurance companies proactively reaching out to us and scheduling demos on our, our dashboard actually demo like this yesterday with, uh, MetLife, um, because all of them are starting to hear it from their clients that they're struggling with this process. And none of them are really looking to. A comprehensive program like Sparrow. Um, they're all looking to either partner or offer some sort of software only play that makes their product a little bit more sticky. Uh, as you're both thinking through this process, I'm curious, you know, around timeline. \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, it looks like you're making a lot of transitions as of 1, 1 20 22 would or 2023. Would this also be, uh, part of that? \n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah, correct. That would be something that we would, we would launch for, for January, for the next year. Perfect. Just always curious because, uh, we do have a 12 week implementation timeline here. Um, so just wanna make sure we're backing into whatever go live date you have in mind to Sparrow is the right fit. And a lot of the implementation timeline is that consulting and benchmarking on your specific leave policy. Um, as well as get that HRS and integration setup. \n",
        "\n",
        "For sure. Yeah. So we're looking to, to make a final decision on the vendor by the, uh, end of July early August at the latest that we have plenty of time. \n",
        "\n",
        "OK. Um, to be fully transparent, uh, you know, if you are looking to make a decision by the end of July, um, My finance team, it's gonna be the end of our Q2, July 31st. Um, and my finance team tends to be a lot more receptive to pricing considerations, uh, at the end of quarters. So through timing is, is great for you. If spar turns out to be the right fit. Yeah, that's good. Next step. RFP to fill out. \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, is that something that you can take care of for us? \n",
        "\n",
        "Yep. I can definitely take care of it, send it over. Um, and then the next step for us, usually in the process is scheduling a deep five in the software experience. So, uh, it sounds like what we should do is all complete the RFP. Um, and then we can schedule a deep dive in a, the software experience. I wanna be transparent around my schedule. \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, I. Actually gonna be out of the office the first two weeks of July. Um, so what I'll do is when you send the RFP, um, I will reply and I will add in my VP of sales and one of my colleagues. Um, so if you are looking to do a demo in those first two weeks, um, one of them will be able to facilitate that for you. \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, I'd like to just get ballpark pricing in front of you both. So you walk away with, you know, uh, what, what the ballpark figure could look like or worst case scenario with Sparrow. \n",
        "\n",
        "I mean, I was already transparent around pricing considerations being end of quarter. Um, we have a one time implementation field, $5,000. Um, and we have a, a. Customer friendly usage based pricing model. Um, so you wouldn't be paying for all 700 of your employees. You're only paying for Sparrow in you're utilizing it. We have a per leave cost and our book rate is $2,200 per leave. With a curly cost. Yeah, per leave cost, um, really allows organizations who have a particular budget. They need to stay within. Um, it allows them to pick and choose which leaves they wanna send to Sparrow and have Sparrow manage versus which leaves they'd like to continue to manage in house. Like if it's a bereavement leave where the employees, you know, great amp passed away and they're taking three to days, maybe it doesn't make sense to send that to. \n",
        "\n",
        "Right. \n",
        "\n",
        "Uh, but if it's, uh, birthing caregiver leave in the state of New Jersey where they're gonna be eligible for state disability, bonding time, they're gonna be getting weighed for multiple sources. Maybe that one makes sense to, to send us spar. \n",
        "\n",
        "Okay. Makes sense. Yeah. So, um, yeah, I'll get that. Um, Get that sent over to you here inviting end of the day. Um, and then, yeah, just like we have a little bit of time, so, you know, take but a week or two, whatever. \n",
        "\n",
        "Um, that's perfectly fine. Um, and, uh, yeah, that'll really be the next step for us. Um, yeah, reach. Platform demo to help us, uh, Get a more hands on, uh, hands on view, what it looks like.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yeah, definitely. Um, that makes sense to me. Uh, so as soon as I get the RFP, I'll reply back actually with also some collateral that I think both of people find useful throughout this evaluation process. And then, um, all introduce my VP of sales and one of my colleagues, uh, so that a demo. Happens while I'm out of the office. Um, they'll be there to assist. \n",
        "\n",
        "Perfect. And I assume that. Is there. Can you also send me pricing through email or, or something that just so I have that on there? \n",
        "\n",
        "I don't remember. Yeah. I actually asked for that. I think that, that I don't remember, honestly, it's been, it's been while, since I've actually looked at the, but it's book. I saying, um, but I would anticipate, you know, if you're looking to make a decision that quickly that my finance team will be open to pricing considerations with it being end of quarter. Also, if you're open as an organization to, um, you know, customer testimonial, completing a customer testimonial with us, uh, you know, you usage of your logo, things like that. Um, Financing is always open to. Discounts for, for those sort of, um, co-branded materials. \n",

So Sparrow was built to help employers like yourselves care for their employees during major life events. So each employee leave can truly be as stress free as possible. Uh, we are the first true end to end leave management solution to effortlessly care for your people. Finding and keeping people has really become harder than ever, uh, medical, dental, vision, 401k. Those were the primary benefits employees asked about over time. Those benefits became patted with benefits like FSAs, HSA, short and long-term disability. But now all of the, those are much more like table stakes. They're all still very important, but some. Are along the way, the conversation amongst employees shifted and even prior to the pandemic, people, leaders started to realize how they cared for their employees would become more important. They started to see employees actually voice what's meaningful to the them and to their loved ones. From home equity work, life balance. What they heard and saw was a range of what people started to share. That was actually on their mind. \n",

So that's another big, big one. \n",

And when there was MIS misalignment employees started to resign and tens of millions have resigned over the last, you know, eight, 10 months caring companies that put people first emerged and provided a new class of benefits that here at Sparrow were calling internally. Employee care management. Companies emerge to address employee leave management, fertility benefits, mental wellness, behavioral health, D E and I, and family care. Um, at snapper, you offering any of these today. I was so. See your therapy, mental, uh, mental wellness is, is something for sure. Behavior health. Yeah.

So it was started by the skim originally and, and hashtag show us your leave started really becoming a trending topic on social media. And I would courage, you know, either of you to whatever social media outlet use type in hashtag show us your leave. Um, employers were actually getting called out for more transparency, um, while carry companies were using it as a. Differentiator to help them attract and retain talent. So a little bit about Sparrow. Um, we have been in business since 2018. We do have a world class end user net promoter score of 76 and a 99% customer retention rate. We manage all types of leave in the us and Canada while saving 20 plus hours and up to $30,000 in average savings per leave.

Your current leave of absence process. Um, I'd love to know what it looks like today. If an employee raises their hand and says they need to go out on leave. \n",
        "\n",
        "So currently we use, uh, our, our HRS ADP. And so we use their lead management solution. And so typically involves us referring them to a website or to make a phone call to ADP, um, that, um, They need, um, they send it back to EP and then, uh, it, you know, typically makes the decision based upon that documentation and just notifies us. It works. Okay. Um, it's not, it's not great just because in general, ADP is not great, but the biggest reason we're searching is cause we're actually leaving the ADP on January one. So, um, with that, we're moving to Workday. So we, we, we need to find. \n",

        "Got it. Okay. Are you moving to Workday for HRS and payroll? Offer any sort of private short term disability today? \n",

        "Uh, yes, we have an employee, employer, employer for visibility at, for great. \n",

        "Any specific carrier you, um, Workday guardian through Lincoln right now. \n",
        "\n",
        "Oh, Lincoln. Changing that over to Unum, um, genuine as well, part as part of the Workday change. <affirmative> a lot of changes coming January one. \n",
        "\n",
        "Oh yeah. I, I imagine your employees are gonna be quite happy to be off of ADP and onto Workday. A lot of them, I think we're gonna have those always just, uh, you know, against, in try to change. And so, yeah, there's always, I think, yeah. Purple. And, um, if an employee goes out on leaves today, like let's use a non birthing caregiver for an example, is that employee eligible to have their salary topped up to a hundred percent. If they happen to be out on leave in a state that offers wage replacement like California, Washington, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts. If it's, I'll obviously if they offer something through the state, right? \n",
        "\n",
        "So, you know, their state, you know, California or state specific disability that they can apply for, um, Uh, you typically don't get too involved in that we, for, for parental leave, we do offer four weeks of paid leave, uh, for people that have been with us for at least a year. Okay. But that the outside of that there is, yeah, everything else is just short term disability or, you know, they can use. You know, approved, pay time off if they wanna cover bar of absence. \n",
